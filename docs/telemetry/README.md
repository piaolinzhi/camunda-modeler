# Telemetry

In this document we'll refer to our internal telemetry server as `ET` :alien:.

## General Structure of the Events
Independent from the type of the event we're dealing with, the payload we send to the ET has the following structure:
```json
{
  "installation": "[THE_EDITOR_ID]",
  "product": {
    "name": "Camunda Modeler",
    "version": "[MODELER_VERISON]",
    "edition": "community",
    "internals": {
      "event": "[NAME_OF_THE_EVENT]",
      "[SOME_ADDITIONAL_EVENT_DATA]": "[SOME_CUSTOM_VALUE]"
    }
  }
}
```

Every event directly modifies the `internals` field of the payload.

## Definition of Events

### Ping Event
The `Ping Event` is sent in following situations:

 - The modeler is opened (given that `Usage Statistics` option is enabled)
 - `Usage Statistics` option is enabled for the first time.
 - Once every 24 hours (given that `Usage Statistics` option is enabled)

The Ping Event has the following structure:
```json
{
  "event": "ping"
}
```

### Diagram Opened Event
The `Diagram Opened Event` is sent in following situations:

 - User created a new BPMN diagram
 - User created a new DMN diagram
 - User created a new CMMN diagram
 - User opened an existing BPMN diagram
 - User opened an existing DMN diagram
 - User opened an existing CMMN diagram

The Diagram Opened Event has the following core structure:
```json
{
  "event": "diagramOpened",
  "diagramType": "[bpmn, dmn or cmmn]"
}
```

In case the diagram type is bpmn, we also add the element template usage to
Diagram Opened Event payload:

```json
{
  "elementTemplateCount": 1,
  "elementTemplates": [
    {
      "appliesTo": [ "bpmn:ServiceTask" ],
      "properties": {
        "camunda:asyncBefore": 1,
        "camunda:class": 1,
        "camunda:inputParameter": 3,
        "camunda:outputParameter": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Also in the case of BPMN diagrams, we add the number of available process variables,
as well as relevant information about user tasks and forms:

```json
{
  "diagramMetrics": {
    "processVariablesCount": 3,
    "tasks": {
      "userTask": {
        "count": 4,
        "form": {
          "count": 4,
          "embedded": 1,
          "external": 2,
          "generic": 0,
          "other": 1
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In terms it is set in the diagram, we add the engine profile:

```json
{
  "engineProfile": {
    "executionPlatform": "Camunda Cloud",
    "executionPlatformVersion": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Deployment Event
The `Deployment Event` is sent in following situations:

 - User deploys a BPMN diagram to the Camunda Engine
 - User deploys a DMN diagram to the Camunda Engine

The Deployment Event has the following core structure:
```json
{
  "event": "deployment",
  "diagramType": "[bpmn or dmn]",
  "deployment": {
    "outcome": "[success or failure]"
  }
}
```

In case the diagram deployment was not successful, the error code returned from the Camunda Engine will be added to the payload:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "outcome": "failure",
    "error": "DIAGRAM_PARSE_ERROR"
  }
}
```

Furthermore, we add the component which initiated the deployment:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "context": "deploymentTool"
  }
}
```

If provided, for example, when deploying to a Zeebe based platform, we add the target type of the deployment as well:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "targetType": "camundaCloud"
  }
}
```

In case of BPMN files, we add the number of available process variables in the diagram as part of the diagram metrics,
as well as relevant information about user tasks and forms:

```json
{
  "diagramMetrics": {
    "processVariablesCount": 3,
    "tasks": {
      "userTask": {
        "count": 4,
        "form": {
          "count": 4,
          "embedded": 1,
          "external": 2,
          "generic": 0,
          "other": 1
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In terms it is set in the diagram, we add the engine profile:

```json
{
  "engineProfile": {
    "executionPlatform": "Camunda Cloud",
    "executionPlatformVersion": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```
